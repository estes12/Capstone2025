That is the link for the build, I finally got it working!

Simple dice rolling simulator. Use + and - to add or remove dice from rolls. 
Click "Roll 'em" at bottom of page and selected dice will be rolled, the total of all dice in the roll will be calculated and displayed on the screen

Update: The total is not displaying on the screen as it is supposed to, will see if I can fix it
